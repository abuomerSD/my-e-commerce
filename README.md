## **Project: "NexShop" - A Modern E-commerce Platform**

**Architecture:**
*   **Server (Node.js/Express API):** A single, centralized RESTful (or GraphQL) API that serves both the Client Website and the Admin Panel. It handles all data, logic, and authentication.
*   **Client Website (React SPA):** The public-facing website where customers browse, search, and purchase products.
*   **Admin Panel (React SPA):** A separate, private application for administrators to manage products, orders, and users. It has a different layout and accesses different API endpoints.

*   **US 6.3 (Admin):** As an admin, I can view, add, edit, and delete products in a management interface (consumes US 3.3).
*   **US 6.4 (Admin):** As an admin, I can view a list of all orders and update their status (e.g., mark as shipped) (consumes US 4.4).

## **Part 2: Sprint Planning (Focused on Integration)**

This plan ensures the Server API is built first, followed by the clients that consume it.

### **Sprint 1: The Foundation (2 Weeks)**
*   **Goal:** Build the core Server API and basic setup for both frontends.
*   **Server Tasks:**
    *   Set up Node.js project structure, ESLint, Prettier.
    *   Implement basic Express server and connect to MongoDB.
    *   Define Mongoose Schemas (User, Product).
    *   Implement Authentication APIs: Register, Login (`/api/auth/`).
    *   Implement JWT middleware.
*   **Client/Admin Tasks:**
    *   Initialize both React projects (e.g., using Vite).
    *   Set up routing (React Router).
    *   Set up state management (Context API/Redux) and HTTP client (Axios).
    *   Create a basic login form in both clients that can talk to the Server API.

### **Sprint 2: Products & Catalog (2 Weeks)**
*   **Goal:** Complete the Product API and build the catalog features on the Client.
*   **Server Tasks:**
    *   Implement Product CRUD APIs (`/api/products`).
    *   Add filtering, sorting, and pagination to the `GET /api/products` endpoint.
*   **Client Website Tasks:**
    *   Build the Product Listing Page to consume the new API.
    *   Build the Single Product Detail Page.
    *   Implement Search, Filter, and Sort UI components.
*   **Admin Panel Tasks:**
    *   *Stretch Goal:* Start building the Product List view in the admin panel.

### **Sprint 3: Cart & Checkout (2 Weeks)**
*   **Goal:** Implement the shopping cart and order processing flow.
*   **Server Tasks:**
    *   Implement Cart APIs (add item, get cart, remove item).
    *   Implement Order APIs (create order, get my orders).
    *   Integrate Stripe API for payment processing.
*   **Client Website Tasks:**
    *   Build the Shopping Cart page.
    *   Build the multi-step Checkout process (Shipping, Payment, Review).
    *   Connect the checkout flow to the Stripe API via the server.
*   **Admin Panel Tasks:**
    *   Build the Order List view (read-only for now).

### **Sprint 4: User Management & Admin Power (2 Weeks)**
*   **Goal:** Enhance user features and complete the Admin Panel's core functionality.
*   **Server Tasks:**
    *   Implement Password Reset flow.
    *   Implement User Management APIs (get users, update user role) (Admin-only).
    *   Implement Order Status update API (Admin-only).
*   **Client Website Tasks:**
    *   Build User Profile page.
    *   Build Order History page.
*   **Admin Panel Tasks:**
    *   Build the Product Management UI (Full CRUD).
    *   Build the Order Management UI (with status update functionality).
    *   Build the User Management UI.

### **Sprint 5: Polish, Test, Deploy (2 Weeks)**
*   **Goal:** Refine the applications and deploy them to production.
*   **All Parts:**
    *   Responsive design testing and polish.
    *   Cross-browser testing.
    *   Performance optimization (image compression, code splitting in React).
    *   Write critical unit and integration tests.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Server:** Deploy to a platform like **DigitalOcean App Platform**, **Heroku**, or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
    *   **Client Website:** Deploy as a static site to **Netlify** or **Vercel**. Configure to proxy API calls to the server URL.
    *   **Admin Panel:** Deploy as a separate static site to **Netlify** or **Vercel**. Often, this is placed on a subdomain like `admin.yourstore.com`.

This separation of concerns makes the project more manageable, allows different developers to work on different parts simultaneously, and results in a much more professional and maintainable final product.
